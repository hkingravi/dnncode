# Deep Neural Networks Code
This is a repository that implements some deep neural networks from scratch. It's basically going to be 
used for personal edification as opposed to serious research code. 

# Installing the project dependencies using a virtual environment
To check out the code and install the dependencies using a virtual-env, use the following steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/hkingravi/FunctionObservers.git
cd DNNCode  # go to main dir
virtualenv dnnenv  # create virtual environment
source dnnenv/bin/activate  # activate the environment
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
./install_dependencies.sh
python setup.py develop
```
